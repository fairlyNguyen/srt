Hi, I'm Johnny Knoxville.
Welcome to <i>Jackass</i>.

51
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,903
No!

52
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,696
- Come on. Just come on.
- Shit.

53
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,950
There we go! There we go!

54
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,161
- A double whammy!
- Oh shit!

55
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,497
- Get it off!
- He got a double whammy!

56
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,583
- Oh! Get it off! Please get it off!
- I can't!

57
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,168
- Oh my God!
- I'm trying!

58
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,921
- He won't stop! He won't stop!
- Oh, please!

59
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,464
- I'm trying!
- Please!

60
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,632
He's bleeding.

61
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,885
Please! Oh my God!
Please let me outta here! Crap!

62
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,845
C'mon!

63
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,515
Oh my God! Fuck you, Jeff!

64
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:32,188
Hello. My name's Johnny Knoxville,
and I'm about to end this movie.

65
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,191
What?

66
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,318
First of all, let me say this.

67
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,488
We've made every <i>Jackass</i> movie
like it's the last one.

68
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,949
We always take on that attitude.
"This is the last one."

69
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:46,369
We did that after the first movie.
We did it after the second movie.

70
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,745
We did it after the third movie.

71
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:52,250
And after the third movie,
I truly did believe that was the last one.

72
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,545
Oh my God! Look in the mirror.

73
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,172
A grown man. Yes.

74
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,634
And, uh, I got a call
from Knoxville, and he's like, "Hey."

75
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,469
"I think, I'm…"

76
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:08,641
"I wanna do another <i>Jackass </i>movie."
I'm like, "Holy shit."

77
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,477
I don't know.
I just had a feeling, y'know?

78
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,898
I'd been writing it
for ten years, since the last one.

79
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,320
And I just got looking through
all the ideas one day,

80
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,531
and I thought,
"These would really be fun to shoot."

81
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:27,160
Then I got that feeling,
which I couldn't get rid of until we shot.

82
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,537
I was 100% sure that the ship had sailed

83
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,748
and that we would never make
<i>Jackass</i> again.

84
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,292
Then all of a sudden,
outta nowhere, after a decade,

85
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,128
Knoxville says, "I'm ready to go again."

86
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,921
Yeah, I know. Totally blindsided me.

87
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,590
But I was stoked. God.

88
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,300
- How you doing?
- Good morning.

89
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,844
- All right. Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

90
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,263
We all knew
we wanted to bring in some new blood,

91
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,681
but I wanted to also make sure

92
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,059
we had the original cast
and get them represented.

93
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,685
They had to be on board with it too.

94
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,229
- Yeah, Wee Man. Good morning.
- Yeah, man.

95
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,023
- Yeah, Johnny.
- What's goin' on?

96
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,359
<i>And then,
as far as finding new cast,</i>

97
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,069
<i>we just reached out to friends.</i>

98
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:05,656
This man right here, Trip Taylor,
is the reason we have this man, Poopies.

99
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,700
- Legend.
- Yeah.

100
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:12,038
Lookin' for some fresh blood,
and Trip's like, "You gotta meet Poopies."

101
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,640
He's just so lovable and dumb.

102
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,183
Ow.

103
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,936
Which is a really good mix for <i>Jackass</i>.

104
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,356
Hey, I'm Jasper,
and I'm gonna jump off this ramp.

105
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,566
I met Jasper in 2010,

106
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,069
when we started shooting a show
called <i>Loiter Squad</i> together.

107
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,487
I knew he'd fit right in.

108
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,989
- You a'ight, Jasper?
- Victory is mine!

109
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,784
I learned about Zach
from the World Wide Web.

110
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:55,665
You'd see these gnarly videos
of a… larger fellow

111
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,751
doing really outrageous stunts.

112
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,753
This is the Suicide Vest.

113
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,805
Yeah, Zach won everybody over.

114
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,307
Fuck!

115
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,268
Jesus Christ.

116
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,811
And how'd you find Rachel?

117
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:20,064
I just liked her Instagram.
I thought she was funny.

118
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:25,528
My mom, she was the judge
that put O.J. Simpson in prison.

119
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,280
- What the...
- Yeah.

120
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:31,284
So basically, O.J. Simpson
got sent to prison

121
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,287
by the same woman who sent me to my room.

122
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,205
But we got out.

123
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,835
- This is Eric Manaka.
- Mm-hmm.

124
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,753
Eric,
did you think when I cast you

125
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,130
for that film in South Africa

126
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,466
that you would be standing here today?

127
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,843
- Never in a million years.
- Covered in semen?

128
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,553
With semen in my mouth, currently.

129
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,971
Mm-hmm.

130
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,682
You've hit the big time, kid.

131
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,145
- Hi, Mum.
- Ooh. Sorry, Mom.

132
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,147
So we got
this great new cast together,

133
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,357
but I think we still all
had some questions.

134
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,569
And then, you know, there's,
like, there's trepidation just on,

135
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,489
y'know, how we're older now.

136
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:13,075
- Like, is it still funny?
- Yeah, I was skeptical. I was… I mean…

137
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,578
- You were the most skeptical.
- I was very skeptical...

138
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,164
We came to you. We were all psyched.
Then you were like, "Uh…"

139
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,876
It was like, "We have to prove it
to ourselves that it's a good idea."

140
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,504
So let's shoot
a couple days but not commit,

141
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,923
and let it tell us that it's a movie.

142
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:31,594
The first thing we wanted to shoot
was a bit that Steve-O shot a while ago,

143
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,597
just to see if the new guys
could really, y'know, keep up.

144
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,017
First of all,
thank you, guys, for being here.

145
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,310
- Yeah.
- Bear with me.

146
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:43,272
This is the first intro
I've done in ten years, I think, so…

147
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,025
- Wow.
- Holy shit.

148
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,819
Oh, stop. Stop. Please stop.

149
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,695
All right.

150
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,533
This is Fire in the Hole.

151
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,995
There's other hot sauces, but this is his.

152
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,373
Wee Man's Chronic Tacos.

153
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,459
For the best in hot sauce enemas.

154
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,045
The old taste of Mexico.

155
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,175
Let's, uh…
let's assume the positions, fellas.

156
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,928
I… Goddamn.

157
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,389
I don't know
where I'm gonna put it in at, Preston.

158
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,100
There might be
some, uh, scrounging around a little.

159
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,227
Okay, everybody insert.

160
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,562
Sorry, bro!

161
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,981
Oh my God, kid.

162
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,608
You gotta make sure it goes up.
It's in his butthole.

163
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:31,696
- To the left! Too much air!
- To the left! The fuckin' left!

164
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,824
Oh my God! No, you're too low!
Higher! Higher! Higher! Higher!

165
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,908
Are you ready?

166
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,744
- You can put it in yourself.
- Hot sauce is goin' in!

167
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,828
Are you ready?

168
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,542
- It's not goin' down!
- Hey!

169
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,627
It's not goin' down!

170
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,589
- I don't have any.
- Oh, Poopies' is going down.

171
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,257
Oh no!

172
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,175
- Slowly going in.
- It burning?

173
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,760
- It's burning!
- It's not going!

174
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:55,720
There you go.

175
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:59,807
- Oh, fucking fuck!
- It's all over my hands now. Ugh.

176
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,310
- Yours isn't goin' in either!
- Oh shit!

177
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,769
- Oh God!
- Jesus!

178
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:04,770
Ehren.

179
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:08,399
- Here, try this pump.
- Okay, we got a pump.

180
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,068
Guys! I got shit on my hands!

181
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,487
- One second.
- We gotta let... Go on, Spike.

182
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,781
- Okay, are you in, Jaws?
- I'm in.

183
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,705
Oh no!

184
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:26,250
Fuckin' put it in my eye!

185
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,171
Guys, watch it. Whoo.

186
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,673
- Yeah.
- Oh God.

187
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:36,344
- Here's some relief, fellas. There you go.
- Yes.

188
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,304
- What flavor you need?
- I want one.

189
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,430
PJ, please.

190
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,141
- He needs a poopsicle real quick.
- There, Preston.

191
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,143
- Who... There you go, Poopies.
- Thank you, sir.

192
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,021
- Relieve your ass.
- Jaws, are you okay?

193
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,523
- It feels so much better.
- It does feel way better.

194
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,275
- Great.
- Good. Doin' the trick.

195
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,027
Oh, yeah.

196
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,570
You dare me to do this?

197
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,867
Ass to mouth. ATM!

198
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,911
- My God!
- Wanna see something? Watch.

199
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,080
Oh God!

200
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,206
Oh shit.

201
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,167
- It's gonna be a fucked-up movie.
- Yeah.

202
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,919
In hindsight, it was like an initiation.

203
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,464
It was like, if you can get through this,
then you can, y'know?

204
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,175
If you don't storm off set going,
"Nothin' doing,"

205
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,053
then it shows that you're down.

206
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,971
I didn't know what to expect with <i>Jackass.</i>

207
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:25,184
'Cause it was this weird feeling
of, "I've known you guys my whole life."

208
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,520
But also, "Oh my God."

209
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,272
"I can't believe
I'm here with them in person."

210
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,902
We're gonna have a little competition
between Preston Lacy and Zach Holmes.

211
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,654
Who can do the biggest long jump?

212
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,657
All competitors follow our instructions
as the gospel truth.

213
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,660
We frown on poor sportsmanship,
gambling, and slang.

214
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,246
- Okay.
- All right. Get in our positions!

215
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,542
Oh God.

216
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,339
- Fuck, I'm prime time! I'm prime time!
- We are fucked.

217
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,512
- He's like, "I'm fucked."
- Stretch it out, Zach. Stretch.

218
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,101
- Right there. There's the...
- You guys are in the sweet spot.

219
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,686
Man, I'm right in there.

220
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,980
- Planned this out well.
- I'm makin' muscles.

221
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,941
I just wasn't thinking, and whoop-de-do.

222
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,568
All right. Good luck.

223
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,070
- Zachary, are you ready?
- I'm ready.

224
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:18,988
Okay.

225
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,824
<i>- ♪ Let me see the Tootsee Roll… ♪</i>

226
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:22,742
C'mon!

227
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,326
Oh!

228
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:26,704
Fuckin' God!

229
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,791
<i>♪ Cotton candy, sweetie, go
Let me see the Tootsee Roll… ♪</i>

230
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,002
Got kneed right in… Oh God.

231
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,297
- How much do you weigh?
- Like, fuckin' 400 pounds.

232
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,591
- Oh shit!
- Approximately.

233
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,593
<i>♪ Cotton candy, sweetie, go…</i> ♪

234
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,179
Oh no. Oh no.

235
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,849
Fuck you, P!

236
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:50,102
Fuckin' dying.

237
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,606
- Dude, I think he's cryin'.
- You went and hit me so hard.

238
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,066
Oh my God.

239
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:02,072
Oh. Now, that was
a straight knee to the nuts.

240
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,407
Sorry, Wee Man.

241
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,035
Judging this contest
is next to impossible.

242
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,955
There's only one way to really find out
which athlete's day will be today,

243
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,999
and that's if they run simultaneously.

244
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,841
Goddamn it!

245
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,470
Oh, that hurt.
That hurt quite a lot.

246
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,015
Oh shit.

247
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,100
That was fun.

248
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,102
The athleticism was dazzling.

249
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,979
- It was magnificent.
- No.

250
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,191
The judges
have, uh, assessed the results,

251
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:40,653
and it's obvious
the clear winner today is diabetes, but…

252
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,031
Wow.

253
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,535
I think by halfway through the first day,
we were like, "Oh, this just feels great."

254
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:51,080
- He just...
- Oh my God. That's amazing.

255
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,958
I mean, it just felt good immediately.

256
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,251
Everyone was psyched.

257
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,253
Everyone was in a good mood.

258
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,588
It was just...
We were getting great stuff.

259
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:03,175
A lot of those bits
from the test wound up in the movie.

260
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,225
- Mom, I'm sorry.
- You don't wanna play, Jasper?

261
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,184
It's cool.

262
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,562
The plexi penis smush.

263
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:18,107
Oh my gosh.
This is where I was like, "Okay."

264
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,359
"Things are gettin'
a little too gnarly right now."

265
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,944
"Things are goin' too far."

266
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,779
But I had to do it.

267
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,991
First time I've ever shown my dick
on camera.

268
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,660
I've for sure never seen
a dick that flat in my life.

269
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:30,953
It was like science class.

270
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,330
You just learn something new.
What the dick can do.

271
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,542
My name's Johnny Knoxville,
and this is Dong-Pong.

272
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,795
- Gentlemen. There you go.
- Thank you.

273
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,299
Holy shit.

274
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,676
- Ah.
- Hey, try and get the ball.

275
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,721
- Ow! Go get that!
- Get it, get it.

276
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,598
Dude.

277
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,892
- Oh my God.
- Fifteen, love.

278
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,187
We just gotta take a breath.

279
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,732
Look each other in the eyes.
Get in sync.

280
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,358
Ping-pong, rally on.

281
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,442
M'kay.

282
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,486
Yeah!

283
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,238
Oh!

284
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,948
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Victors!

285
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,868
Let's try this.
This is like a mini tug-of-war. See how…

286
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,328
- Back up.
- Oh.

287
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,662
- Ow.
- Oh, dear.

288
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,748
Ow! Oh my God! Ow!

289
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,754
Ow! Oh my God! Ow!

290
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,340
It's a slider! Oh my God!

291
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,966
That was my first day,

292
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,887
meeting everyone and then seeing
all of their dicks and their buttholes.

293
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,598
And then it felt like family after that.

294
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,726
- That's a wrap on this test.
- Sorry, sorry.

295
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,019
Amazing job, everyone.

296
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,812
Thank you, everybody.

297
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,942
<i>And so, after the two-day shoot,</i>

298
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,903
<i>me, Spike, and Knoxville all said,
"It's a go."</i>

299
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,238
<i>"And it's definitely… It feels right."</i>

300
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:53,702
<i>So, we officially began shooting
the movie on March 3, 2020.</i>

301
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,912
Here they come.

302
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,540
Yeah, legend.

303
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,210
- What up?
- What's up? How are you?

304
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,420
- Good, and yourself?
- Good, man. I'm ready.

305
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,465
Got the boys here.
We got the crew. First stunt of the year.

306
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,176
Um, first stunt of the movie, actually.

307
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,552
- Yeah, Cordell.
- 'Sup, buddy?

308
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,905
- How're you?
- Great to see you.

309
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,348
Good to see you.
So, yeah, we're on. Good to see you.

310
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:17,685
Yeah, man.
Are you excited to get things picked up?

311
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,894
Dude, I'm so excited.

312
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,772
I've been waitin'
pretty much my whole life for this, so…

313
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,316
I mean, we're…
I'm workin' with legends right here.

314
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,609
I mean, it's crazy.

315
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,902
I'm excited.

316
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,572
Can you guess who I am, Dimitry?

317
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,658
- Who?
- Can you...? I'm Tesla.

318
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,786
Tesla's under-admired.

319
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,373
And this is going to do
nothing to help that.

320
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,166
All right.

321
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,796
This is our friend James,
an esteemed scientist.

322
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,047
- You're a scientist?
- Yes.

323
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,131
What is that?

324
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,591
That is an electric eel.

325
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,344
They can put out up to 600 volts.

326
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,847
So, the idea
for the electric eel was that,

327
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,726
"Can electricity come
from this animal, go through somebody,

328
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,020
and into a metal key
and then into somebody else?"

329
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:01,937
Yeah.

330
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:02,938
That was funny.

331
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,607
Oh, man. Wee Man tryin' to do intros?

332
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,486
He could not get those intros right,
and it was so satisfying.

333
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:14,783
Hi. I'm Benjamin Franklin,
father of electricity,

334
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,036
and this is an electric eel.

335
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,164
Countrymen, natives…

336
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,498
Wait, no.

337
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,583
- Romans.
- Friends.

338
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,709
- Friends.
- Romans.

339
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,627
- Romans and countrymen.
- Countrymen.

340
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,298
Friends, Romans, and countrymen,

341
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,300
show me your rears.

342
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,387
<i>Lend </i>me your ears.

343
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,015
- Show him your rear!
<i>- Lend </i>me your ears.

344
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,185
Friends, Romans,
and countrymen, lend me your ears.

345
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,439
- Okay. Oh, yeah.
- Ready? Yes.

346
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:50,319
Friends, Romans, and Ehren,
lend me your rear.

347
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,905
Oh gosh!

348
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:53,822
It did.

349
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,533
- Jesus!
- Are you ready?

350
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,626
Keep it on there, Wee Man.
Get the key in.

351
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,926
Did it work?

352
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,596
- Yeah, it worked. We got electricity, man.
- What? Fuckin' key, man.

353
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,473
What do you think the lights are on for?

354
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,229
We learned that electric eels
do conduct enough electricity

355
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,649
to go through Wee Man,
into a key, into a butthole.

356
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,527
It's like, we learned important things.
Science things.

357
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,279
- Yeah. Who knew?
- Who knew?

358
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,115
We ended that day on a high.

359
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,158
And I remember

360
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,621
going home that night,
and it was my birthday.

361
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,748
And I got a call from Spike,

362
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,876
and I'm like, "Oh, Spike's callin'
to wish me happy birthday."

363
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,670
And he's like, "Hey man."

364
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:53,674
"Uh,
we're going to shut down."

365
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,426
I'm like, "What do you mean?"
He goes, "COVID."

366
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:01,181
And I was... I just couldn't wrap my head
around us shutting down.

367
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,642
We didn't know
if it was gonna be for two weeks,

368
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,519
if it was gonna be for a month.

369
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,814
- Exposure to someone positive?
- No.

370
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,899
All right.
You're gonna get swabbed twice.

371
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,819
So if you need to blow your nose,
go ahead and do so now.

372
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,362
Because of the coronavirus,

373
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:19,032
today is our first day
filming again in seven months.

374
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,910
- Notice anything different?
- A funny thing happened.

375
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,663
When we came back,
Johnny Knoxville had gray hair.

376
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,166
- Thank you. We're good?
- You're okay.

377
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,249
All right.

378
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:32,588
I'm all safe to shoot
a very dangerous film.

379
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:37,134
And then, we're one of the first movies
in Los Angeles that's back up and running.

380
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,469
Good morning. Whoo. Day one.

381
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,514
And we're almost like guinea pigs.
Like, it was tricky.

382
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,725
And we had to get tested every day.

383
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,060
There was just
a whole new set of safety protocols.

384
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,438
Steve-O just coughed.

385
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:53,942
I'll get Ebola.

386
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,820
So, let's use that to our advantage.
Like, let's…

387
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,156
Let's throw a COVID safety meeting.

388
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:03,118
This is Don,
our "COVID safety officer" for today.

389
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:07,581
He will be running the guys through
some safety precautions while on set.

390
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:11,043
And, uh, man, I just hope it goes well.

391
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,756
There's Pontius, Zach.

392
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,633
Well, my name's Don Ruffin.

393
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,010
I'm a COVID-19 compliance officer.

394
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,512
I'm here to help implement
the standards by the CDC

395
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,181
to help you get... keep you guys safe.

396
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,016
So, we wanna keep the crew...

397
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,064
Oh my God!

398
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,944
What the fuck, you asshole?

399
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,822
Jesus Christ! Fuck!

400
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,160
I thought
the world was ending for a second.

401
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,414
I thought that was a COVID test.

402
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,667
Aren't we supposed
to take this shit seriously?

403
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,544
That was a real good way
to get back into…

404
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,506
And at that moment,
I truly realized, like,

405
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,424
we're fucked.

406
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,718
Like, anything goes.

407
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:06,098
Uh, we, as, uh, the cast,
are basically gonna just be

408
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,767
tortured for the next year.

409
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,852
- Whatever.
- Oh my God.

410
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,189
That was the first thing
we shot back from COVID.

411
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,441
So already, the guys were on their toes.

412
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,610
And plus, with the new protocols,

413
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,571
they knew we weren't gonna be able
to shoot as much man on the street,

414
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,616
so we were gonna take that out
on the cast.

415
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,910
Hi. What's up, everybody?
My name's Poopies.

416
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,496
I'm the newest member
of the <i>Jackass 4</i> crew.

417
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,291
What is gonna change
about your life once this comes out?

418
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,167
Well, I think that, um…

419
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,546
Well, one thing that I think
is gonna change in my life is, uh,

420
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,381
the fame.

421
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,509
But I don't let that get to me, dude.

422
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:45,721
I just wanna be by the beach,
surfin' and chasin' chicks my whole life.

423
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,099
So, I mean,
that's gonna be definitely a plus,

424
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:52,227
but I just wanna make
more… more projects and film more...

425
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,523
Oh my gosh, dude.

426
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,151
- Oh, bro!
- Are you okay?

427
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,529
- Are you okay?
- Oh my gosh! That was a good slap, dude.

428
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,782
Holy shit.
Knoxville, good morning.

429
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,743
I'm always on edge
when I'm on set because,

430
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,536
y'know, anything can be a prank.

431
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,706
What the fuck?

432
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,959
- What the fuck?
- Oh my God!

433
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,377
I knew it!

434
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,671
- I fuckin' knew it!
- Oh my God!

435
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:23,425
Like, this could be a prank right now.
I don't fuckin' know.

436
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,052
You know?

437
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,721
And every... Nothing is real.

438
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,390
- Let's lay it down.
- What the fuck?

439
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:41,443
Sorry. It's so nerve-racking in here.

440
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:45,489
What's the grossest bit
that was shot so far in this movie?

441
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:46,989
Huh.

442
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,701
Oh.

443
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:56,875
Jesus.

444
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,668
Jeez.

445
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,755
That was five gallons of horse semen!

446
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,387
Clear.

447
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:13,392
I'll fuck you up!

448
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,394
They told me
they was doing something. I forgot.

449
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,037
Sayin' they were scaring somebody else.

450
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,689
Next thing you know, I'm locked in a room.

451
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,234
But I never imagined
they'd put me in a room with a bear.

452
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,945
Hey, man!

453
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,739
Hey, hey!

454
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:31,410
Hey, get that fuckin' bear, bro!
Hey! Aw, shit.

455
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,121
Hey, man! What the fuck, bro?

456
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,498
He's trying to hide!

457
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,670
- Help! Hey, man, get this damn thing, bro!
<i>- Dark Shark.</i>

458
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,423
My dad's in there
with a bear right now.

459
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,384
Dark Shark,
those trees aren't real.

460
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,760
You can't climb them.

461
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,477
He's biting me! He bit me!

462
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:02,149
Throughout the years, y'know,
I slowly developed more and more PTSD,

463
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:05,318
just like any of the other guys,
about what's really happening

464
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,778
or if we're getting pranked.

465
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,822
And I'm gonna have to say that that came,

466
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,116
for me, at a height
at <i>Silence of the Lambs</i>.

467
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,452
That was… They took it too far.

468
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,786
Doggone it!

469
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,079
Oh fuck!

470
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:21,460
We got locked in a pitch-black room
and tortured for like 20 minutes straight.

471
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,836
It was terrifying.

472
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,046
Hey, what do you guys
want us to do...? Ow!

473
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,798
Ow! Ow!

474
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,259
- You guys are fuckin' assholes!
- Guess!

475
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,847
I hope it's funny, but, man, to be
in that moment, it was… it was…

476
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,807
It was like…

477
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:39,936
I thought I was gonna die,
and not a… a painless death.

478
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:44,274
That was… I don't remember
being that scared, like, maybe ever.

479
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,150
Fuck!

480
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,115
Oh, man, dude. I still don't…

481
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,618
It's so hard to trust.
Is it over? Is it over?

482
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,785
It's over.

483
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,205
It's over, bro.

484
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:02,042
I'm scared of what you guys do,
you guys go through.

485
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,377
Like, no one's safe.

486
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,796
Fuck! Why?

487
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,260
And, uh, I was, like,
kind of scared every time I showed up.

488
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,763
I was, like…
I was very nervous the first day.

489
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,892
Get your temperature taken.

490
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,686
All right.
You're all good. There.

491
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:27,859
Thank you.

492
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,154
- Actually, I'm gonna pee quick.
- We're ready.

493
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,657
- I'm gonna pee.
- Oh, okay. Go.

494
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:44,751
I fuckin' knew it! I fuckin' knew it!

495
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,629
I knew it. I knew it, you motherfucker.

496
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,006
I fuckin' knew it!

497
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,259
Yeah!

498
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,344
- Yeah!
- Fired up!

499
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,389
That thing caught on fire, dude.

500
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:01,017
- Oh my God! Oh my God!
- I peed, like, all over myself.

501
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:04,938
Went into the porta-potty,
and it fuckin' exploded.

502
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,566
Like, hook, line, and sinker.

503
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,485
Like, I produce pranks
for a living.

504
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:15,240
And the whole cast
plays it so well, I had no idea.

505
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,408
It's one of those things.

506
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,160
When you watch it growing up,
you're in love with it,

507
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,373
but when you're actually there on set,
you're like, "This is fuckin' hardcore."

508
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,500
Hello, governor.

509
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:30,505
We're here with Eric André,
world-famous elephant hunter.

510
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,091
And we're gonna do
a little big-game hunting today.

511
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:37,012
This might be
the diphtheria, but they look delicious.

512
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,140
- That's fuckin' gnarly.
- Which way are we gonna go?

513
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,559
If there's one thing
any schoolboy knows,

514
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,978
it's hunting big game requires a big gun.

515
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,773
This is a bad day
to be an elephant.

516
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,191
So bad.

517
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,152
It appears they're linked together.

518
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,321
Is that how they snog?

519
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,574
Oi! Dead ahead.

520
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,576
- Aim for the mother!
- Hup, hup!

521
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,744
Okay!

522
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:01,745
Powder!

523
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:05,123
- Thrust, thrust.
- And fire when ready.

524
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,210
Got one!

525
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,630
Oh!

526
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,674
Twenty pound sterling bounty
on the baby elephant.

527
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,344
Twenty quid for a baby?
Are you mad?

528
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,305
Oh fuck!

529
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,640
He's feisty.

530
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:25,226
He'll make a fine decoration
for the sitting room. Ha ha ha!

531
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,354
Fully reloaded!

532
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,731
They're getting tired.
We've got 'em tired.

533
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,399
God save the Queen.

534
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,151
Got him!

535
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,236
You got him
square in the bojangles.

536
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,613
Right in the ivory!

537
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,323
- Incoming!
- He's down!

538
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,700
Motherfucker, dudes.

539
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,244
Would someone provide this elephant
with a veterinarian?

540
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,704
He seems hurt.

541
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,248
Keep shooting. What are we doin'?

542
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,583
We gotta get it again.

543
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:52,253
We don't have this yet. Like…
Can you take another? You're all right.

544
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,756
My favorite part of that
is Knoxville trying to get you

545
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,801
to go talk
to the elephants, who are upset.

546
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,844
And I feel like
that's a big part of the thing.

547
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,555
You guys are like...
You're good cop, bad cop.

548
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,683
You need to go talk to the elephants.

549
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,101
- They're good.
- They're good.

550
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,395
- Preston's good to go?
- Preston, you're good, right?

551
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,480
I don't know.
It's startin' to swell up.

552
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:14,901
- Ah, fuck. It hurts so bad. Oh, shit.
- Let's reset. We're goin' again.

553
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:17,821
- Let's go after the bull.
- You guys are thirsty.

554
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:21,032
- You're around your watering hole.
- You guys go on one leg. Go on one leg.

555
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,951
- Just happy.
- Move the camera.

556
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:26,162
Show them. The elephants
need to be on this side of the pond...

557
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:29,040
- Fuck!
- Good show!

558
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,337
Right in the fuckin' tuchus!

559
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,758
It's weird, though.
They don't like seeing me get hit or hurt.

560
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:39,843
- Really?
- Yeah.

561
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,486
- What are you talkin' about?
- Yeah, what are you talking about?

562
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:46,266
What? Everyone cheers when,
like, I stun-gun you or, like…

563
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:49,602
People were so happy
when you got shot by the elephant gun.

564
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,020
- Yeah.
- Are we ready?

565
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,856
I'm sorry. I'm on cloud nine.

566
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:56,526
I dropped my accent and everything.

567
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,653
Show me what you got here.
Oh my God.

568
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,113
That thing hurt.

569
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,866
But then our hunt
was rudely interrupted by an explosion.

570
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,453
I think... Was it Ehren
that was blasted out of the toilet?

571
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,333
Okay!

572
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,419
- Get him!
- Okay. Put the gun down!

573
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,504
- Gun down.
- It's loaded. It's hot!

574
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,883
What the fuck! Ah, goddamn it!

575
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,594
Seriously?

576
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:23,762
Fuck you guys!

577
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,764
- Yeah! We got Ehren!
- Holy shit!

578
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,312
- It got you?
- What do you mean, did it get me?

579
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:35,732
We were shooting in the field,
and we saw a huge fireball from over here.

580
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,817
Everyone dropped the whole bit
and started running.

581
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,486
Are you fuckin' kidding me?

582
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,073
- Okay.
- What are you, Johnny?

583
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,494
I'm a fuckin' flamingo. What do you think?

584
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,828
What? I dunno.

585
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,247
So, what's gonna happen here
is we're swinging.

586
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,251
And they're coming down,
and they're gonna get in our way.

587
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,961
But our goal is to really damage them,

588
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:00,298
and their goal is to,
uh, somehow avoid us,

589
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,633
but they're not going to.

590
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:05,261
I'm Jasper,
and this is the Swingset Gauntlet.

591
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,472
- Mya!
- Ooh-whee!

592
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,224
Nya!

593
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,477
- That's your cow sound?
- That's your, uh…

594
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,146
Yeah, I'm a different type of cow.

595
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,191
I wanna see a little pelican head
go flyin' across the yard.

596
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:21,528
Look at the pelican fly!
Come on, pelican!

597
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,946
All right, start pumpin'.

598
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,406
You had me at "start pumpin'."

599
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,624
Watch your head!

600
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,545
Oh my God.

601
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,799
Oh.

602
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,680
Are you okay?

603
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,347
Holy…

604
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,519
- Are you okay?
- Dude.

605
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,522
- Holy shit!
- Are you all right?

606
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,941
He spun
in the air like a fuckin'…

607
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,776
Dude!

608
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,945
- Did I do it right?
- Oh my God!

609
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,531
- I didn't even know what happened.
- Oh my God!

610
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,075
I was cruisin' along
on my cool little box here.

611
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:11,494
Fuckin' dickhead Ehren
smashed the fuck outta me.

612
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,832
I didn't land in the soft sand.
I landed back on this bullshit.

613
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:19,168
Your head broke your landing.

614
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,797
Hi, Nick Merlino. Bye, Nick Merlino.

615
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:29,095
I'm gonna clobber that crustacean.

616
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,139
Okay, go.

617
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,932
Get the speed, Chris.

618
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,436
I'm gonna pulverize that prawn.

619
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,482
Oh my God!

620
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,694
Holy shit!

621
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:48,531
Dude, he did, like, four flips. Dude.

622
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:52,035
- Dude.
- Pontius, that was a good one.

623
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,995
- Holy shit.
- That was great.

624
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,122
Yeah, that knocked
the wind outta me.

625
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,041
- Dude.
- That fuckin' sucked.

626
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,001
Hey lobster, you lost?

627
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,338
Awesome.

628
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,385
It was really fun
to bring back Irving Zisman.

629
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,220
We haven't seen that guy in a while.

630
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,515
You gotta see the manager in here.

631
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,143
You should see the bunglestein on her.

632
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:20,063
I'd like to tap her like a keg.

633
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,023
Oh no.

634
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,484
No?

635
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:30,531
Okay.
What kind of a thing should I…

636
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,617
'Cause she's a little sweet on me too.

637
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,409
Man.

638
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,914
- I feel like...
- She's about your age.

639
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,415
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

640
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,500
Damn.

641
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,086
- Maybe...
- Don't go blowin' up my spot.

642
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,713
Gotta watch out.

643
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,176
Yeah, I don't need
any cockblocks around here.

644
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,845
It's Brad?

645
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,766
- Yeah.
- You wanna have some fun?

646
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,060
- Yeah, man.
- Okay.

647
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,276
Oh.

648
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:14,117
Irving, what did you…
what did you do that for?

649
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,995
What should we do now?

650
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,663
- Oh my goodness.
- Hold onto that.

651
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,039
That's a pretty nice soup bone.

652
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,919
Mm, my goodness,
check out the torpedo on that submarine.

653
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,131
He's got a broomstick like a banana slug.

654
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,757
How...? Oh my God. Oh wow.

655
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,009
Hi, Cheryl.

656
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,261
Oh, fuck. Hello, Irving.

657
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,597
- What the hell did you do now?
- I didn't do it. He pulled it.

658
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,558
What?

659
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,077
Why do what? You pulled it!
You said, "Watch this" and pulled it.

660
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,898
Oh, why are you being
a cockblock? Talk me up.

661
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,651
You're bein' a cockblock. Talk me up.

662
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:53,698
He's your age,
so he's, like, trying to hit on you.

663
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,785
And it's not a good time
for you to do that.

664
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,872
- I…
- What?

665
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,290
- What's your name?
- Brad.

666
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,333
- Did you pull the fire alarm?
- No.

667
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,294
- Okay. Irving says you did.
- I know...

668
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,047
All of you who think Brad did it,
raise your hand.

669
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,551
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What's your problem?

670
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:17,388
Ah. Wow, this is my kind of party.

671
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,932
- All right.
- I kinda feel like partyin' right now.

672
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:28,024
Oh! Hey, oh!

673
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,448
Come on, Brad. Let's get rad.

674
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,492
- C'mon!
- Yeah, man.

675
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,078
Yeah, Brad!

676
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:43,664
Brad.

677
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,791
Yay!

678
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,001
Yeah, Brad! Yeah, Brad!

679
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,630
- Good luck, Wee Man.
- Thanks.

680
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,883
That's one of the disco-iest
camel toes I've ever seen.

681
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,095
Stop, okay?

682
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,763
Oh my God.

683
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:02,475
I'm Wee Man, and this is the Ballknocker.

684
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,689
- It's fuckin' party time, man.
- Yeah.

685
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:18,449
Three, two, one, go!

686
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,243
Oh shit!

687
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:23,746
Fuck.

688
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,627
- Wee Man, are you okay? Holy shit.
- Jason? Jason, speak.

689
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,712
- That was intense.
- You okay?

690
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,256
- Yeah.
- Talk. Talk, talk.

691
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,550
- Am I bleedin'?
- No.

692
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,970
- How did that feel?
- It felt like a car crash.

693
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,931
- It looked like a car crash.
- Fuck.

694
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:42,932
Oh my God.

695
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,935
- How do you feel, Zach?
- Dude, my asshole hurts.

696
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,980
How does your asshole hurt?

697
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,440
I don't wanna hear anything about that.

698
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,485
- You asked me how I felt.
- I know. But why does that hurt?

699
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,113
I don't know!

700
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:00,449
- I don't know!
- I don't know what bit you just did.

701
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,247
So, on <i>Wildboyz</i>, we filmed this bit

702
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:10,293
where we were in Africa,
and we had fish attached to strings.

703
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,128
Like, cinched up around our packages.

704
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:16,340
It's time for a little penis fishing.
We're fishing for fish eagles!

705
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,843
And so, the eagles
would swoop down, grab the fish,

706
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,469
and then yank our packages taught.

707
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,144
Oh my God!

708
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:31,314
But MTV wouldn't let us air it.
It was a little graphic.

709
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:34,025
And so we thought,
"Well, let's try to do that idea."

710
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,444
Like, I got word
that this guy had two fish eagles.

711
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,988
I'm like, "Ah, fish eagles.
I've got an idea for that."

712
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,491
I gotta tell ya, breaking bones
and shovin' things up your butt

713
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,452
doesn't get any easier with age.

714
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:45,952
I'm just kidding.

715
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,372
Shovin' things up your butt
gets a lot easier.

716
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,958
I'm Steve-O,
and this is the Dine and Dash.

717
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,172
- Oh no.
- Oh God.

718
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,758
The basic idea
was shove a fish up Steve-O's butt

719
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,677
and have an eagle come
and just grab the fish hard

720
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,055
and fly off,
hopefully grabbing some of his butt

721
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,306
and flying away with it.

722
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,434
But the fish eagle just,
kinda just gently lands next to him.

723
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,519
Oh my God.
I just saw his fuckin' beak.

724
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,022
- He's checkin' it.
- Just smack it.

725
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,815
Oh my God.

726
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,192
- Ow!
- Oh my God!

727
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:19,612
- I saw it come out of his asshole!
- Ow! Oh!

728
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:22,615
- Ow!
- He got the first fish easily.

729
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,909
So, well, we got…
we gotta make something out of this.

730
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,703
So, we just stuffed the fish
a little further up in there

731
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:31,082
and wrapped it up
around his balls and stuff.

732
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:35,127
Do you want to, uh,
really rub the fish all over my balls?

733
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,587
Ooh.

734
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,756
I can.

735
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,133
Do we have a rubber band? Ah, no?

736
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,219
Jesus Christ. How big are his nuts?

737
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:46,055
I don't know how... My God.

738
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,266
I got a hair tie. Would that work?

739
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,435
- You're a genius.
- I want that back, though.

740
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,728
I need...

741
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,273
- Wait, Steve-O, I'm not...
- Hey, no cheap shot!

742
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,150
It doesn't get any cheaper than this.

743
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,487
Let him get every last scrap.

744
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,406
Come on, man. That's HomeTown Buffet.

745
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,782
Oh shit.

746
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,452
His beak is so fuckin' gnarly. Oh shit.

747
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:12,957
- Need to go for it.
- Oh shit!

748
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,167
Ah.

749
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,753
Eat more.

750
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,339
Oh!

751
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,550
Literally a bottom-feeder. Yeah!

752
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,435
Ow!

753
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,770
Here I am, like, butt naked.

754
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,523
I got, like, stickin' stuff up my butt,

755
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,984
and my balls were on the line.

756
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,780
Oh! Oh!

757
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:48,284
- He literally ate your ass.
- Oh, he really did.

758
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,245
- Does it look sweet?
- Give Pontius his hair tie back.

759
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,205
Dude, I'm gonna sell this on eBay.

760
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,208
Yeah.

761
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,295
I'm not surprised that bit's in 4.5.

762
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,881
- But I wasn't givin' up on the raptors.
- Yeah.

763
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:05,551
So, we got a raptor
to rip off my eyebrows.

764
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:06,635
That was amazing.

765
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,512
- Put your chin down.
- Okay.

766
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,681
After we're all done, after it's all over,

767
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,976
I want you to relax
with some cucumber and elderflower water.

768
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,979
That's crazy.
Look at that big motherfucker.

769
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,607
- Do you like birds?
- I ain't sayin' nothin'.

770
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,319
Yeah, no. I'm scared of birds.
You can't tell I keep jumpin'?

771
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:26,739
Dark Shark was funny during that bit
because he's so scared of birds.

772
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:31,285
Yeah, I'm… I been scared of birds
since I was, like, ten years old.

773
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,120
You know, I got a phobia.

774
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,791
- We're ready to go.
- Oh, shit! Oh, damn.

775
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,168
Oh, shit.

776
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,629
That motherfucker
ready to go, got business.

777
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,838
I'm serious.

778
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,387
I'm gonna be well groomed.

779
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,430
You're gonna be as smooth as the new guys.

780
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,024
Let's see.

781
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:05,152
Got one little bit still left.

782
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,113
There's a tiny racing stripe.

783
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,907
That's the way
they're wearing them these days.

784
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:13,327
Ow.

785
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,731
Know what? I have those eyebrows.

786
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,122
- I saved them.
- Oh, did you?

787
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,374
Yeah.
I thought it'd be a good idea.

788
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:22,336
After <i>4.5</i> comes out, we can auction them
off to charity to help the kids.

789
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,671
- That's great.
- Yeah.

790
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,214
You look really sexy.

791
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,883
If you think I look good now, just wait.

792
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,720
Job's only just begun.

793
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:35,182
Yeah, I didn't even realize
how badly I missed working with Chris

794
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,017
until we started shooting this movie.

795
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,853
Yeah, we just have the best time.

796
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:43,274
Yeah, I think it makes us become better
than our own individual selves.

797
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,317
It makes our personalities multiply.

798
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:48,028
Chris and I together
is better than the sum of its parts.

799
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,364
That's the word, yes.

800
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,159
The problem was,
once we ripped his eyebrows off,

801
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,827
now we got Steve-O with no eyebrows,

802
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,497
and we're only two-thirds of the way
through the movie, so…

803
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:02,334
I walked out, and I was like,
"What the hell ramp is that, dude?"

804
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,670
Like, "What kind
of sissy operation is this?"

805
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:07,339
And then I found out
that he's wearin' a rocket pack.

806
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,968
I'm like, "Okay, cool. I'm in."

807
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:14,054
Welcome to my Fantasy Island.

808
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,432
Today, we got a couple
of hot-shit water skiers,

809
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,767
Parks Bonifay, Poopies,

810
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,394
a rocket jet pack.

811
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,271
I mean, what's the worst
that could happen?

812
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:24,815
Oh, and we also got,
uh, Bunny the Lifeguard.

813
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,693
Kind of a new alter ego.

814
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:30,821
Creepy porno dude.

815
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,532
- "Creepy porno dude."
- Yeah, there we go.

816
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,618
So, where are we gonna fuck?

817
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:41,832
Poopies, with the two liquid CO2
rocket-powered backpacks,

818
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,919
and he's gonna edge out
of the big red kicker.

819
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:48,255
And then he's got a little strap here,
and as soon as you pull that,

820
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,579
she kicks, and you're goin'
for a ride for eight seconds.

821
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:55,387
Poopies, when you hit the ramp,
hit the jet pack for additional thrust.

822
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,223
I'm Bunny the Lifeguard,

823
00:41:57,306 --> 00:42:00,434
and this is Hot Shit Water Skiing,
take 69.

824
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,894
Yeah.

825
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,146
- You good?
- Yeah.

That was
about 20 feet before the ramp.

834
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,508
I pulled it, and I think I fell forward.

835
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,843
Yeah, it pushed you forward
into the water.

and give Parks a chance.

00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,341

Dude, I knew when I was up there
it was gonna hurt, and then it hurt.

859
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,050
- You ready?
- Yep.

860
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,846

- Yeah.

00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,517
I didn't have a first try.

863
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,145

through filming <i>Jackass 4</i>…

865
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:14,985
Um…

866
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,821
…my testicles, obviously.

867
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,828
He sees it.

868
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:28,415
Easy!

869
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,751
I will say, seeing

870
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:34,088
Danger Ehren's crotch get mutilated

871
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,675
while I was on set helped me

872
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,719
feel comfortable
'cause I would just be, like,

873
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,012
anytime I got hurt,

874
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:47,267
I was like, "It's not as bad as getting
a pogo stick to your testicles."

875
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,936
They're ripped to shreds.

876
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:52,856
I mean, I think you guys...
You lit him up more brutal in this movie

877
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,608
than, uh, the previous three.

878
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,776
Meh, I don't know.

879
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,528
You ripped his fuckin' tooth out

880
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:00,823
and cracked his skull in half
and broke his neck three times

881
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,449
and threw him into a wall.

882
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,910
Keep hittin' him!

883
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,036
It's kinda…

884
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,666
It's kind of funny
how you destroy Ehren.

885
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,919
I'm here with professional bowler
Missy Parkin,

886
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:17,715
and this is
the Cup Test with a Bowling Ball.

887
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:22,052
And I will let you know that I do use
the heaviest ball you're allowed to use.

888
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,847
- Oh God.
- I use a 16-pound bowling ball.

889
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,724
I don't know if this is the right cup.

890
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,392
- It's got...
- Yeah, it's right.

891
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:30,728
It's got really bad edges. Like, it'll...

892
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,531
Missy, what do you think
of Ehren's chances?

893
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:36,191
I mean, I'm gonna…
I'm gonna definitely hit that, so…

894
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,404
This is… this is the danger zone.

895
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,573
Uh, please just hit him, Missy.

896
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:46,034
Okay.

897
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,203
Oh God.

898
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,748
Oh my God. I don't know what to do.

899
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,086
Oh, that was on the leg!

900
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,177
Hey!

901
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,053
Oh my God!

902
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,390
- It hit you on the leg first.
- The leg slowed it.

903
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,393
- That was deflected.
- Are you sure? It didn't feel like it.

904
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:14,021
No, that was…
That was… It went, "Boom, boom."

905
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,606
Oh my God!

906
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,940
I'm gonna…

907
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,735
Dude, I'm not gonna take one
like that again. I can't.

908
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:22,696
- Missy did her job perfectly.
- It's in my butthole.

909
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,990
Like, I swear to God,
it's hurting in my butthole.

910
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,077
- Sit down! Sit down!
- I don't think I can do it, man.

911
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,288
- I can't do it!
- You have to sit down!

912
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,916
- I can't do it!
- Wanna do it while he's standing?

913

<i>Jackass 4: Breaking Ehren.</i>

914
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,170
Do you think he could go again?

915
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:41,673
I think he could absolutely go again.
You could do one more.

916
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,550
She's a professional, Ehren.

917
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,219
- Come on. Man up.
- I just, like…

918
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,223
Ehren, are you ready? Don't move.

919
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,682
Am I in the right position?

920
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,976
You're just making her angry,
Ehren.

921
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,111
Oh!

922
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:06,365

Oh, Ehren's always had my respect,
even though he can be annoying.

928
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:33,392
Like, he always gets great footage,
and he, like,

00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:38,689
I mean, 'course,
he didn't mean to be.

931
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:39,815
But he was.

932
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,279
I'm Poopies, and I'll show me.

933
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,745
- Dude.
- Like Steve-O.

934
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,455
That was a knocker, bro.

935
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,583
Ah, my teeth hurt.

936
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,127
Oh, that drop came fast.

937
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:03,672
Ow. My teeth are numb.

938
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,048
You showed you.

939
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:08,844
Fuck me. I just fucked myself right there.

940
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:14,391
So, here we are
on the Paramount back lot,

941
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,935
where they shot <i>The Godfather</i>,

942
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,813
<i>Chinatown</i>, <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's.</i>

943
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:23,066
And we're shooting <i>Zach Sashimi</i>.

944
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:27,905
Mm-mm! This is Zach Sashimi. Everyone?

945
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,824
Find a fold and put in the sashimi.

946
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,286
- Got some nice tits, Zach.
- Thanks, Steve.

947
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,539
Oh!

948
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:42,127
How deep are we with this guy?

949
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:46,423
Whoa. Watch it slide.

950
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,552
Let's cook that sushi.

951
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,721
Are you ready
to get in the best shape of your life?

952
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,766
Time for some wind sprints.

953
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,185
Gonna cook it
in Zach's own juices.

954
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,437
- Much like ceviche.
- Oh, man.

955
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,899
- Really focus on that form.
- Fitness.

956
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,108
Oh.

957
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,902
- Jog now.
- Go, Zach.

958
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:09,529
I'm gettin' harder
than Portland cement right now.

959
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,783
All right, let's get started.

960
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,994
- I'm goin' in.
- It's belly-button time.

961
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,747
We have to be careful
this doesn't just become chaos.

962
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,834
Yeah!

963
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,587
- Oh!
- Oh, wow.

964
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,382
- Great job, Rachel.
- How could you?

965
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,800
I've had worse things.

966
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,344
Fuck, that was gross.

967
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,055
- In here.
- Like a petri dish.

968
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,307
It's slippery.
It's slippery from his sweat.

969
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,351
Tear it open
like a bear going for salmon.

970
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,979
- Yeah!
- Superfood.

971
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,730
Superfood.

972
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,610
It's slippery.

973
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:54,032
This is the first bit we've ever shot
on the Paramount back lot,

974
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,575
and may be, well, our last.

975
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,828
Open up, Bubba.

976
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,249
You got it. Swallow it.

977
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,459
- You got this.
- Hold your ground!

978
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,628
Oh, gross.

979
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,256
It's disgusting Zach
more than anyone.

980
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:13,135
- The thong.
- Gotta be something in there.

981
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,095
Oh, look at that. Jesus.

982
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:18,432
- Wow.
- Look at how slick he is.

983
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,475
Oh. Ugh.

984
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,352
All right. Hey, guys.

985
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,187
You like shrimp?

986
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,064
I see one
with Steve-O's name on it.

987
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,941
Steve, feast on that eel.

988
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,860
Should I… should I do it no hands?

989
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:31,820
Steve-O going for the no-hander.

990
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:34,072
- That's wet-ass bootie.
- No-hander.

991
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,158
Oh yeah.

992
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:38,952
- This is not...
- Leaning down in everyone's puke.

993
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,417
Oh my God!

994
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,380
Can we get… can we get…

995
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,632
Get it down. Get it down.
No, no, no, no, no.

996
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,721
- You got it, Steve-O.
- Hold it together.

997
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,144
Feels like we've really crossed a line.

998
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,938
Oh God.

999
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,106
I can't believe it.

1000
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:12,402
Focus. How you doin', Lance?

1001
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:15,363
Can we get Lance another mask?

1002
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:19,076
How many times
did you puke this film, Lance?

1003
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,745
I think it was six.
I tried to stay off camera.

1004
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:25,749
So, you puked once or twice
in past movies and six times in this one.

1005
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,752
- That was a record.
- That's a record.

1006
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:31,379
I came for sushi, but I had salad.

1007
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,883
Jeff was joking with me before

1008
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:38,261
about like, "You're gonna find sushi
somewhere when you get home."

1009
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:41,056
And I was thinking,
"Oh, ha ha. You know, whatever."

1010
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,391
I'm pretty sure
he found one two days later.

1011
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:48,063
He sent me a photo of a piece of sashimi
that he found two days later.

1012
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,774
It was nasty. So messed up.

1013
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,070
- Hello.
- Hi. How's it going?

1014
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,446
- Good.
- Hi.

1015
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,950
- This is my grandpa.
- Hi.

1016
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:00,867
Hi.

1017
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,470
- My name is Alex. How are you?
- Good.

1018
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,620
- Alex?
- Alex, yeah.

1019
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:04,913
- Irving.
- Irving.

1020
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,540
- I'm Rachel.
- Hi, Rachel.

1021
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,875
Um, so, I just have
a couple meetings today,

1022
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,837
and I just need you to, like,
sit with him for a couple hours.

1023
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,881
You don't have to babysit him,
but just kinda keep an eye on him.

1024
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:18,802
And then just one thing.
Like, just make sure he doesn't smoke.

1025
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,053
Like, that's all.

1026
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,930
- All right. Thank you so much.
- Of course.

1027
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:24,558
- Have fun, Grandpa. Be good, okay?
- All right, baby doll.

1028
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,725
- Love you.
- Right.

1029
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,435
- It was Irving, right?
- Yes.

1030
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,937
What would you like to do?

1031
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,691
There's a little coffee truck
right around the corner.

1032
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,652
Would… would you mind getting me a coffee?

1033
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,654
- Do you want black coffee?
- Please.

1034
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:39,781
- With no sugar? Nothing?
- No sugar.

1035
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:40,907
I'm sweet enough.

1036
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:50,374
Help!

1037
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,587
- Where are you?
- Help!

1038
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,965
- Where are you?
- Help?

1039
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:57,883
Whoa.

1040
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,010
- How did you get up there?
- Help.

1041
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,095
Oh my God. Don't move.

1042
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,222
- Don't move.
- Oh my God.

1043
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,018
Don't move.

1044
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:12,355
- No! No, you're not supposed to smoke.
- I gotta smoke. I'm nervous.

1045
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,482
- Mm.
- Don't move.

1046
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,028
- Mm. Mm.
- Oh my God, please. You're gonna fall.

1047
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,821
Oh! Oh! Ah!

1048
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:23,200
Oh shit! Oh God!

1049
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,579
- Oh my God!
- Oh shoot!

1050
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,581
Throw the coffee! Throw the coffee!

1051
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:32,417
Oh, ow! Ow!

1052
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,752
Throw it! Throw it!

1053
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:34,961
Ow!

1054
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,801
Oh my God!
Don't move. You're gonna fall!

1055
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:45,055
You want a smoke?

1056
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,306
No, I don't want a smoke.

1057
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,389
Do you have weed?

1058
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:48,767
I don't have weed.

1059
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:49,935
Do you have acid?

1060
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,686
- No, I don't.
- Come on!

1061
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,939
Oh my God!

1062
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,609
Oh! Oh my God!

1063
00:53:57,692 --> 00:54:00,070
These things will kill you.

1064
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,322
Oh, my back!

1065
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:04,740
Okay.

1066
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,952
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1067
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,578
Ow!

1068
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:16,211
I haven't been able to walk in two years.

1069
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,213
- Okay.
- Bless you.

1070
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,425
You're giving me a heart attack.

1071
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,347
Get some of this…

1072
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,183
in the folds.

1073
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:32,852
Thank you.

1074
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,479
Jeff loves painting me.

1075
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,773
He really likes
all the detail and everything.

1076
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:39,609
Getting in every crevice, under each roll.

1077
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,695
Makes sure you're painted really well.

1078
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,156
How did you first
become familiar with Jeff's work?

1079
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,076
I saw… like, when I was a little kid, uh…

1080
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,703
When I was in elementary school,

1081
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:52,080
I was told
I wasn't allowed to watch <i>Jackass</i>.

1082
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:56,167
And I just… I would have to,
like, sneak to watch it on TV.

1083
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,546
Yeah. I lived in a super,
like, Christian household,

1084
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,589
and they were, like…

1085
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,009
They were just anti-MTV and everything.

1086
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:08,096
So, I would just watch it and have
another channel on the channel return.

1087
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,515
It was pretty dope.

1088
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:14,102
- Three, two…
- Shirt looks a little small.

1089
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:17,522
I had Emily
take the extra-large tag

1090
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:21,109
and put it in a size medium shirt.

1091
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:23,945
Tuck. You have to tuck it.

1092
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,031
- It's a tuck deal?
- Yeah. You gotta tuck it.

1093
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,283
You left me
a lot of room to tuck, asshole.

1094
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:33,747
It was funny because when they set it up,
it was supposed to be a winch,

1095
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,833
but the winch wasn't gonna work out,
so they just tied a truck to me.

1096
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,501
I was just pulled by a truck.

1097
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:41,379
- That's really somethin' else.
- This is half-assed, even for us.

1098
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:45,925
- That's a big ball.
- That's a really big ball.

1099
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:49,012
Four hundred pounds
of baseball right there.

1100
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:51,264
I'm Zach, and it's time to Play Ball.

1101
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,558
Some people call this pitch a slider.

1102
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,060
I call it a spitball.

1103
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,982
Let's break up the party.
We got a game to play.

1104
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,734
- All right. 'Kay.
- Let's do it.

1105
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,446
I warn you, I'm wearing sexy lingerie
under this uniform.

1106
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:22,379
Batter, batter!
Batter, batter, batter! Batter, swing!

1107
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,839
Whoa!

1108
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,516
- You all right?
- Oh my God! Are you okay?

1109
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:35,642
Strike!

1110
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,979
Good job, you guys. That was awesome.

1111
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,565
- Jasper, way to…
- Yes, sir.

1112
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,317
Way to watch it.

1113
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,531
It was pretty scary.

1114
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:52,617
Yeah, like, granted,
we had these just mini pads on,

1115
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,495
like baseball players, but he took us out.

1116
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,625
He knocked me
outta my shoes too.

1117
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:03,169
Sorry, guys.
I didn't know my own strength.

1118
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:12,095
Do horse riders usually carry
a whip the size of a license plate?

1119
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:15,682
Fuck!

1120
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,350
- I'm so sorry.
- Jesus!

1121
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,437
- Oh yeah.
- Fuck you! Ow!

1122
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,814
Oh my God! That sounded terrible.

1123
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:25,108
It got me right on the dick head.
Like, right...

1124
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:27,068
Fuck!

1125
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:28,194
And it hurts!

1126
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,906
It was right on the very fucking head
of my dick. Sorry for the coarse language.

1127
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,409
Ah.

1128
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,329
This is the Blindfold Race.

1129
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:42,459
We'll have four contestants
compete in a 50-yard sprint,

1130
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,002
blindfolded.

1131
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:46,087
We show up.
It's a simple racetrack.

1132
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,256
There's nothin' in the way.
It's a clear path.

1133
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,842
Then right when you put on
those blindfolds,

1134
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:55,680
oh, here comes all the objects
that we're gonna pretty much fall over

1135
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:59,267
and get destroyed on,
but we didn't know they were there.

1136
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:01,895
- I think Poopies' is good.
- Yeah, I can't see shit.

1137
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:07,442
I didn't expect anything
to be in that runway at all.

1138
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:09,611
All right. It's time to race.

1139
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:12,322
Okay. On the gunshot, you will run.

1140
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:15,074
On your mark, get set…

1141
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,160
Go, go, go, go!

1142

- And the winner is Poopies!
- Aw, man!

1166
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,179
Wow!

1167
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:21,099
- Man, he was in a full sprint.
- I got whacked so hard.

1168
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:23,226
He hit his head really hard
on that sawhorse.

1169
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:25,186
Poopies naively dashed.

1170
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,021
Wow, Poopies. You were, like…

1171
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,273
I was telling you...

1172
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:31,526
…twenty seconds ahead of…
30 seconds ahead.

1173
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:33,837
I know. I know.
I felt the marbles, and I was like, "Oh!"

1174
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:37,365
And then… 'Cause none of that stuff
was out there.

1175
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:40,827
No way! Really?

1176
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:46,249
Well, Captain Obvious.

1177
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,710
- So, I was like…
- That's my horse.

1178
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:49,793
Yeah.

1179
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:09,772
Whoo-hoo!

1180
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:10,982
Yeah!

1181
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,067
Ow! Fuck!

1182
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:15,486
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.
- I'm sorry.

1183
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,822
Oh, fuck!

1184
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:22,869
Look, we're not just
growing old, we're growing up.

1185
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:25,330
Join me in the fight
against unwanted pregnancy

1186
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:27,957
by buying my signature Steve-O condom,

1187
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,251
the Dick Helmet, at steveo.com.

1188
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,837
They're virtually unbreakable. Watch.

1189
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,006
Time for a Steve-O
signature condom break.

1190
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:41,012
I had the idea
when I saw this, uh, condom-drop thing

1191
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:43,389
with putting the condom on people's heads.

1192
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,604
As soon as I saw it, I thought, "Oh, man",

1193
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:53,274
fill up a condom
with the sewage tank on my RV,

1194
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:55,109
"and then that'll be epic."

1195
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:57,779
So, for weeks on end,

1196
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:03,201
I just belligerently refused
to empty the sewage tank on my RV.

1197
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:05,495
Did that sewage come
from you and all your bros?

1198
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:07,664
I've been saving up
for weeks, dude.

1199
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:11,584
Oh my! Oh gosh!

1200
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,921
- These are quality condoms.
- Yuck.

1201
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,926
- Wow.
- That's not apple juice.

1202
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:23,137
I can't.

1203
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:26,474
What was Steve-O
trying to accomplish?

1204
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:29,435
Uh, advertise his condoms,

1205
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:33,106
which he stopped selling after that bit.

1206
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:35,775
Boy.

1207
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,944
They were poppin' like paper bags.

1208
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,153
Ow!

1209
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,155
Oh!

1210
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:47,870
You might've wanted to test this idea
before you brought it to… to the set.

1211
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,581
Oh my God.

1212
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:52,709
That Steve.

1213
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:55,837
Put your finger in it!

1214
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,424
- Put your finger in it!
- Oh God.

1215
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:01,467
Don't get greedy.

1216
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,885
C'mon, man.

1217
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,346
- Okay.
- That's your bowels.

1218
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,434
Hey, guys. I got one.

1219
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:10,768
That's a shitty condom.

1220
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:16,691
Oh my God!

1221
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:18,735
I got it. I got it.

1222
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:21,821
No!

1223
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:25,199
Yeah, we were trying to fill it up
and get the most we could in it.

1224
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:29,120
And lucky me was right there
when it was about to burst, and it did.

1225
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:33,207
And just got loads of flecks
on my face, on my clothes.

1226
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,959
It's in my mouth!

1227
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:37,128
Oh no!

1228
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:39,881
Oh!

1229
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:42,133
- We never quite got it, right?
- We never got it.

1230
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:44,635
Either the condom
would bounce off my head…

1231
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:48,055
One, two, three.

1232
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:49,682
God!

1233
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,642
…or it would break on my head.

1234
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:54,562
We had to have tried it like 15 times.

1235
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,439
No!

1236
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:57,690
…three.

1237
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,025
Fuck!

1238
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:01,444
Fuck!

1239
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,825
I'm Poopies, and this is pee pee.

1240
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:12,747
Oh my God, dude!

1241
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:15,458
Seriously, there's so much piss
on you, dude.

1242
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:19,003
So, you have a signature condom, though.

1243
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:22,673
I was toying with the idea
of coming out with Steve-O condoms.

1244
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:25,593
And in hindsight,
that's the worst idea I've ever had

1245
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:28,471
because condoms and Steve-O
have never been a good mix.

1246
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:33,476
It's red only.

1247
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,149
OMG!

1248
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,818
Oh man!

1249
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,653
Whoo. Six to midnight.

1250
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:46,739
That's that hot-shit tennis coach
I was talking about earlier.

1251
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,742
I think it was my first day on set,
so I was geeking out.

1252
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,036
I was like,
"This is how the sausage gets made."

1253
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:53,159
"This is fuckin' awesome."

1254
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:54,747
I'm putting on my clown outfit

1255
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:58,960
and taking in the whole cast
and crew and seeing how it's done.

1256
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:01,295
And then I was like, "Oh no. This sucks."

1257
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:04,882
Like, "I'm gonna get a tennis ball
to the fuckin' neck and the balls."

1258
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:07,760
This is our tennis star, Shannon,

1259
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:10,513
and it's time to play Down the Clown.

1260
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:12,598
- Be gentle with me.
- Mm-hmm.

1261
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,350
So, how fast do you serve, Shannon?

1262
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:15,935
Up to 100 miles per hour.

1263
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,270
- Hey?
- Mm-hmm?

1264
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:20,898
Uh, Poopies said he doesn't believe you.

1265
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,859
- You don't?
- I didn't say that.

1266
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:25,194
- Totally said that!
- He said it!

1267
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:27,405
- Oh, I'm mad now.
- Yeah.

1268
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:28,906
That hurts!

1269
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,119
Oh!

1270
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:36,706
Why'd you get me?

1271
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:38,165
The fuck?

1272
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:41,127
- You need to get Poopies.
- Yeah. Poopies is the one way left.

1273
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,128
Way left.

1274
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,755
Poopies' wiener is asking for it.

1275
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:50,136
Yeah!

1276
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,096
Yeah!

1277
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:53,598
- Calm down.
- Right.

1278
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,768
What about this side, Shannon?

1279
01:04:57,852 --> 01:05:01,647
Ow. Motherfucker! Goddamn it!

1280
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:03,524
Leave the rookies alone!

1281
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,696
He only has one ball, and you hit it.

1282
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,950
- I gotta get that middle one.
- Ooh.

1283
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,245
There you go.

1284
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,373
I've gotten hit. Oh shit.

1285
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,375
She's reckless.

1286
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,256
Oh!

1287
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:32,678
- She hit me twice!
- Oh, man.

1288
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,555
Oh, one man standing.

1289
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:36,515
Chest up. Chest up.

1290
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,225
- Chest up!
- Make me proud.

1291
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,810
Yeah.

1292
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,062
Get him good.

1293
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,732
C'mon!

1294
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:47,401
Oh, wow.

1295
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,320
Yeah, Shannon. Whoo.

1296
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:51,072
- Yes. Oh my God.
- Nice.

1297
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:53,240
- God!
- Nice.

1298
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:55,826
Oh God,
that was so fuckin' right on.

1299
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:58,079
Thank you, Shannon.

1300
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:00,623
Way to go.

1301
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:02,917
You're welcome?

1302
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,419
I heard Knoxville
go over to that tennis professional,

1303
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,880
and he goes,
"See that big fat guy over there?"

1304
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,632
"I want you to hit him right here."

1305
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:11,926
Where I'd been shot by the elephant gun.

1306
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:15,054
And I thought that it'd be pretty hard
for that tennis lady to do that.

1307
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:16,697
But no, she could curve it right there.

1308
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:18,140
- Whoa.
- Let's see.

1309
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:19,058
Let's see, P.

1310
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:20,935
Oh my God! She hit that?

1311
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:22,853
- This center part is new.
- How dare you!

1312
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,814
- Literally a bull's-eye.
- This is new.

1313
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:27,608
It's like tie-dye.

1314
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:33,906
All right, you guys. We're up
in one of the buildings right here,

1315
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,784
and, um, they're filming the opening,
so, take a look.

1316
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:39,036
<i>Background and action!</i>

1317
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:49,463
Whoa, dude.

1318
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:52,466
Oh my God!

1319
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:55,511
Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville.
Welcome to <i>Jackass</i>!

1320
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:57,722
So, the big opening sequence
of <i>Jackass Forever</i>

1321
01:06:57,805 --> 01:07:00,391
started off as a much smaller idea.

1322
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:04,812
We wanted to do
this sort of '70s monster movie,

1323
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:07,898
where Chris's penis
was attacking a miniature city.

1324
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:11,193
The airbrush is chillier
on the balls.

1325
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:13,237
- It was never gonna be the opening.
- Right.

1326
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,697
It was always gonna be a bit.

1327
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:16,741
What's gonna happen?

1328
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:21,829
Well, the sea monster
is going to lay waste to this town.

1329
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:25,791
Trying to get our talent
in the proper position

1330
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,377
for, uh, the sea monster to perform.

1331
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:30,588
There we go.

1332
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:33,340
I see the fearsome sea monster.

1333
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:36,052
I mean, poor Chris was
in the most awkward position

1334
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:37,470
'cause he's under the set.

1335
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,930
You look
like you're having sex with the set.

1336
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,141
I kind of am.

1337
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:45,603
And we basically cut a hole
in the middle of the street,

1338
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:48,230
and Chris had to fit his penis through it.

1339
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:52,526
Well, the monster's "thighs,"
his balls,

1340
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:56,614
kept dropping down
from underneath the, uh, sandpaper street

1341
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:58,240
we had built for him.

1342
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,076
Here. I'm going to...

1343
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,453
- I've gotta push your balls through, okay?
- No worries.

1344
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:05,456
- Okay. This is me, Pontius.
- No worries.

1345
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:09,960
Like, I knew we had a problem,
and I knew I had a solution.

1346
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:13,589
And by God, I was right there.

1347
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:17,635
And if Pontius needed me to do that again,
I'd be there again.

1348
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:22,098
I wasn't plannin' on this
when I came to work today.

1349
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:24,475
Let's try to make this happen.
Let's go.

1350
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:26,727
Well done.

1351
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:28,979
- Yeah, moviemaking.
- Mm-hmm.

1352
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:32,233
I think as soon as we started shooting it
that day, we were like,

1353
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:35,569
"This is a great idea,"
and then we looked at the test footage.

1354
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,452
Man, it looks so funny.

1355
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:46,705
And that's when we decided to make it
the open and not just a bit.

1356
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:53,671
- I started getting excited.
- And then the idea started growing.

1357
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:55,589
Three, two, one!

1358
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:01,428
- Yeah. Then the idea started growing.
- And then kept growing.

1359
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:14,191
Yeah, it kept growing.

1360
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:15,901
And the budget kept expanding.

1361
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,736
- It kept doubling.
- It kept doubling.

1362
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:21,699
Background and action!

1363
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:30,082
I just wanted it to be right.

1364
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:33,794
And I would settle for no...
Nothing but the best.

1365
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:36,338
Every time Spike
opened his mouth, it was just, like,

1366
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,049
millions of dollars
were just falling out of it.

1367
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,719
Uh…

1368
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:43,304
Pretty exciting.

1369
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:45,431
- Hey!
- It's a big deal, dude.

1370
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:48,809
It's an expensive dick joke.

1371
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,228
The opening sequence
and the ending

1372
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:54,064
have always felt
like real, blockbuster Hollywood.

1373
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:56,525
- Yeah.
- We feel like movie stars when we do this.

1374
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:57,735
Oh, yeah. It's so fun.

1375
01:09:57,818 --> 01:10:00,946
- Rest of the time, we feel like schmucks.
- Yeah. Exactly.

1376
01:10:06,243 --> 01:10:09,121
- Okay, stop! Stop.
- He said, "Stop."

1377
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:17,046
- I hit my head fuckin' hard.
- Listen, lay down that way.

1378
01:10:19,798 --> 01:10:21,008
Did we get it?

1379
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:27,139
Did we get it?

1380
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,558
- We... We good?
- No, we don't.

1381
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:31,393
It was really strenuous to film.

1382
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:34,230
It was… it got so physically demanding.

1383
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,690
I'd always be in these weird positions.

1384
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,525
He's completely vulnerable too.

1385
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:41,445
And it's cold
where we were shooting, and, like...

1386
01:10:41,528 --> 01:10:43,781
And we're shooting pyro
that he can't even see.

1387
01:10:43,864 --> 01:10:48,035
There's all this pyro on either side,
just blasting little debris into his dick,

1388
01:10:48,118 --> 01:10:49,870
and he doesn't even see it coming.

1389
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,664
Tell me about these puppeteers.

1390
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:53,249
It's very exciting.

1391
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:56,085
The puppeteers are very exciting people.

1392
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:58,921
My favorite thing is, like,

1393
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:02,758
we pulled out, like,
the best people on every level.

1394
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:05,636
The guy who's puppeteering it,
he's the guy who did

1395
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:07,846
the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man
in <i>Ghostbusters</i>.

1396
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,932
He's just got this list of credentials.

1397
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:12,643
We brought in Elia Popov,
who does special effects

1398
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:14,311
for these huge blockbuster movies.

1399
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:17,231
And this really talented DP, Shasta Spahn.

1400
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:20,234
And our production designer,
Shepherd Frankel, who does Marvel movies,

1401
01:11:20,317 --> 01:11:22,361
designed this amazing set for us.

1402
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:26,198
- And Tony Gardner's done these really...
- Academy Award-nominated movies.

1403
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,867
People who have worked their way
to the top.

1404
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,287
We're just dragging everybody down
to their lowest.

1405
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:36,125
They brought their A-level skills
to our D-level idea.

1406
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:41,297
Why did we come up with so many ideas
that were penises? What was our…

1407
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:42,881
Apparently, as you get older…

1408
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:45,384
- That's all you can think of?
- It's all you can think of.

1409
01:11:47,344 --> 01:11:50,139
But <i>Jackass Forever</i> has more penis in it

1410
01:11:50,222 --> 01:11:52,933
than any R-rated movie
in the history of R-rated movies.

1411
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:55,686
- More penis hits or more penis?
- Just penis in it.

1412
01:11:55,769 --> 01:11:59,481
Penises are biologically fascinating
and so underused,

1413
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:02,860
like, as far as movies go
and just entertainment.

1414
01:12:02,943 --> 01:12:03,861
I don't know why.

1415
01:12:03,944 --> 01:12:05,738
It's like, little boys know it.

1416
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:09,408
When you're a little boy, you run around,
doing crazy stuff with your penis.

1417
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:12,411
Flippin' it around,
peein' on things, doing all this stuff.

1418
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:16,582
It's like, why do we all forget that
as we go into adulthood, y'know?

1419
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:19,418
So, thank heavens
that we didn't.

1420
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:22,504
'Cause there's so much
you can do with it.

1421
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,883
Now it's time
for a friendly game of chance.

1422
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:27,926
Here we stand,
with our penises tethered to bricks

1423
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,179
that we're going to drop
to the ground below.

1424
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:32,806
Unfortunately, one of the strings
is too short.

1425
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:35,642
Actually, two of the strings
are too short.

1426
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,061
I wonder who it is.

1427
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:42,232
We don't know.
That's why we have to play the game.

1428
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:44,651
- I know, dude.
- Are we ready?

1429
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:47,946
Three, two, one, drop.

1430
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,745
Bro.

1431
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:58,415
- Yeah.
- Ow.

1432
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,919
Oh, it's bleeding. Oh, it's bleeding.

1433
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:03,253
Ah.

1434
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:06,006
Oh shit!

1435
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:11,470
The thing is, is where you tie it
is behind your balls.

1436
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,222
So, I only have one ball,

1437
01:13:13,305 --> 01:13:17,017
so I don't have that anchor point
that some of the other guys do.

1438
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:20,270
Threw the brick, and it slid past that
and caught me mid-shaft

1439
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:22,481
and just pinched as tight as it could

1440
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:26,777
and then stretched my wiener to a…
I'm gonna have to say a good foot long.

1441
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:30,155
I really don't think you could come closer
to ripping your dick off than that.

1442
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:34,451
I really don't think you can, and I am
so dumb for agreeing to do it at all.

1443
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:36,912
Just, the vein.

1444
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:38,831
- My dick's ruined!
- Oh!

1445
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:40,290
Holy shit.

1446
01:13:40,374 --> 01:13:42,209
It has love spikes now.

1447
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:45,003
That bit was like a bruised dick.
You just can't beat it.

1448
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:52,344
Making these movies is really probably
the funnest thing that I think you can do.

1449
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:55,764
God. What a great time it's been,
hanging out with all your friends.

1450
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:59,393
It's so rare to have the chemistry
of this… of a group of people

1451
01:13:59,476 --> 01:14:01,728
that come together
to make something like this.

1452
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:04,064
And every single person
is so important to the mix.

1453
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:06,733
Everyone was gonna make this one count.
It was obvious.

1454
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,445
It felt like we were all unsure
going into it,

1455
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:12,322
but coming out of it,
it felt as good as all the others.

1456
01:14:12,406 --> 01:14:15,784
In the friendships that not only remain,

1457
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:18,579
but have gotten stronger
over the years, uh,

1458
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:23,459
really mean a lot, and, uh, for us
to still be doing this after 20 years…

1459
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:27,629
For there to be interest
and for us to physically be able

1460
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:31,175
and for it to be as fun as it is,
I think that's special.

1461
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:36,346
So what we have
behind me is my dad, Dark Shark.

1462
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:43,187
He made his name up himself, but this man
is a OG Crip gangbanger from Los Angeles.

1463
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:45,606
Doesn't bang anymore,
but been through a lot.

1464
01:14:45,689 --> 01:14:49,276
Been to prison multiple times,
probably did a lot of dirt in the hood.

1465
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:52,029
You know, been through...
How many times you been shot?

1466
01:14:52,529 --> 01:14:53,906
Got nine bullet holes in me.

1467
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:55,616
Been shot nine times, still here.

1468
01:14:55,699 --> 01:14:57,743
But when it comes
to little things like birds

1469
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:00,287
and flying in a, I don't know, a airplane,

1470
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:02,414
just simple things
you don't see in the hood,

1471
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:04,416
it makes him very scared.

1472
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,753
Dark Shark is terrified of flying,
and, uh…

1473
01:15:08,754 --> 01:15:11,924
So we thought, "All right.
What's the scariest thing we could do?"

1474
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,051
Let's make him skydive.

1475
01:15:14,134 --> 01:15:16,261
Then we started adding on to the bit.

1476
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:19,598
Like, "Yeah, let's make him skydive.
Let's make everything go wrong."

1477
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:22,518
This is Jasper,
and today we're gonna fulfill

1478
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:25,604
your father's lifelong dream
of jumping out of a plane.

1479
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:26,813
He's very excited.

1480
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:28,440
- Yes.
- He's not excited.

1481
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,651
I'm scared as fuck.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1482
01:15:30,734 --> 01:15:32,486
Scared as fuck, fuck, fuck.

1483
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:35,531
But, um, y'know,
I'm with the big boys now, you know?

1484
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:38,033
Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O,
Wee Man, and them.

1485
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:41,662
He doesn't know that "the plane
is gonna take a little oopsie."

1486
01:15:41,745 --> 01:15:44,581
And also, the pilot's gonna jump out
in the middle of it.

1487
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:46,750
So, shit is gonna get
a little bit of real.

1488
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:49,294
Scared of airplanes, scared of heights.

1489
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:54,132
Second time I'm ever on a fuckin' plane,
and I'm finna jump out.

1490
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,885
He's flown once before.
And how did that go?

1491
01:15:56,969 --> 01:15:59,555
We took this man to Hawaii,
and he cried the whole way there.

1492
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:01,265
Had his eyes closed the whole time.

1493
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:04,434
Yeah, I been scared of planes
all my life. I pump myself up.

1494
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:06,311
That was my first time on a plane.

1495
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:09,481
I closed my eyes the whole way.

1496
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:12,150
Tears in my goddamn eyes.

1497
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:15,112
Not cryin',
but, uh, tears came out my eyes.

1498
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:19,074
This is Boyd, our pilot.
He's gonna be flying the plane today.

1499
01:16:19,157 --> 01:16:24,413
And Boyd, I just beg of you,
just no turbulence, as safe as possible.

1500
01:16:24,496 --> 01:16:26,039
Don't upset Dark Shark.

1501
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:27,332
- Nice and smooth.
- Yeah.

1502
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:28,709
- I can do that.
- Thank you.

1503
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:31,962
Oh Lord.

1504
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:37,342
From Longwood, California…

1505
01:16:38,802 --> 01:16:43,348
…the workin' girls' dream,
the old maids' delight, Dark Shark!

1506
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:44,891
I'mma cry like a bitch.

1507
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:46,602
How'd I get here?

1508
01:16:48,562 --> 01:16:52,065
- How'd I get here? A blessing, though.
- Bring it in. We got this.

1509
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:55,152
- Yeah, Dark Shark. You got it, buddy.
- Goddamn.

1510
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:57,362
- You ready?
- Hell no.

1511
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:02,618
Yeah, Dark Shark.

1512
01:17:03,243 --> 01:17:05,162
Already got the first step done.

1513
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:07,455
Yeah.

1514
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:14,713
You got this.

1515
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:18,717
Our pilot is solid as they come.

1516
01:17:21,887 --> 01:17:23,055
Whoo.

1517
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:25,766
Yeah, Dark Shark.

1518
01:17:27,559 --> 01:17:30,854
How high are we gonna be when we jump?
How many feet?

1519
01:17:30,937 --> 01:17:32,022
- Two thousand.
- High.

1520
01:17:32,105 --> 01:17:34,691
- Thirteen thousand feet.
- First for me.

1521
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,699
Everyone's wavin' to you, Dark Shark.

1522
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:52,459
He was so terrified, right?

1523
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:55,337
He was in a fear lock on the way up.

1524
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:59,966
He just took both of his elbows
and just pressed them into me and Jasper.

1525
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,427
And he just… he was somewhere else.

1526
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:06,264
As the plane takes off,
you know, he's already terrified.

1527
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:07,724
He's just, like…

1528
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:12,813
He ain't sayin' nothin',
and then Johnny's cracking little jokes.

1529
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:14,106
You got this.

1530
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:18,860
He doesn't got this.

1531
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,780
It was real quiet on that plane,
aside for me mouthing off.

1532
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:24,199
We're at 4,100 feet.

1533
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:28,912
I kept telling him, like,
"Oh, 3,100 feet, 4,700 feet."

1534
01:18:28,995 --> 01:18:30,288
Just tryin' to get in his head.

1535
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:32,666
Now we're at 7,000 feet.

1536
01:18:36,753 --> 01:18:39,214
It's pretty smooth, though, right? Really.

1537
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:42,008
Why the fuck you get on this damn plane?

1538
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:44,052
How you doin', Dark Shark?

1539
01:18:49,015 --> 01:18:52,394
I was tryin' to hold back from not going
fuckin' berserk on that plane.

1540
01:18:56,022 --> 01:18:57,232
Is this on?

1541
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:03,446
Huh?

1542
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,034
Whoa.

1543
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:10,203
Whoa.

1544
01:19:14,207 --> 01:19:15,959
Goddamn, now, look at that shit.

1545
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:17,461
Fuck!

1546
01:19:17,544 --> 01:19:21,047
And then, as we're all standin',
they have the pilot, um,

1547
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:22,883
start shakin' the plane a little bit.

1548
01:19:23,383 --> 01:19:24,926
- Oh! Oh shit!
- Oh Lord!

1549
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:27,721
- What the fuck is that?
- Oh shit!

1550
01:19:27,804 --> 01:19:32,058
And then from there, the plane starts
to "smoke" from the smoke machine.

1551
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:35,771
Hey! Look at the floor.

1552
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:36,938
Hey!

1553
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:38,774
Hey, man! What the fuck, bro?

1554
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:40,275
- There's smoke!
- Hey!

1555
01:19:40,358 --> 01:19:42,527
So, when all the rest
of that shit went down,

1556
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:45,071
I was already scared to the fullest.

1557
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:48,033
So, in my mind,
I'm tellin' myself, "I'm gonna die today."

1558
01:19:49,409 --> 01:19:51,661
And then, the pilot comes up.

1559
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:54,331
He's faking to put the smoke out
with a fire extinguisher.

1560
01:19:54,414 --> 01:19:55,749
He looks at Dark Shark and says…

1561
01:19:58,168 --> 01:20:00,420
What the fuck? That's the pilot!

1562
01:20:00,504 --> 01:20:03,089
- Oh, shit!
- That was the pilot.

1563
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:06,009
I gave up on livin'
for the first time in my life.

1564
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:08,512
And I've been shot
in the head, face, neck.

1565
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:11,807
Everything, never gave up,
but I just had enough.

1566
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,225
I was just so scared.

1567
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:15,352
That was the pilot!

1568
01:20:15,435 --> 01:20:18,355
- Let's go. Come on.
- Let's go.

1569
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:32,035
Whoo!

1570
01:20:46,591 --> 01:20:51,555
Meanwhile, when I jump out,
my parachute had almost fallen off.

1571
01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:55,183
I didn't know, but I didn't have
my, uh, straps on my shoulders.

1572
01:20:55,892 --> 01:21:00,397
And if you look at the footage,
like, my straps on my shoulders

1573
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,524
get all the way down to my elbows.

1574
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:06,570
And then I just wiggle them on,
and boom, they hit the parachute.

1575
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,995
Oh my God!

1576
01:21:15,078 --> 01:21:17,706
I was prayin',
"You fucked. You deserve to die."

1577
01:21:17,789 --> 01:21:20,417
You know, in my mind.
So I was just praying, like,

1578
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:23,086
"Just don't go to hell.
I don't wanna go to hell."

1579
01:21:23,169 --> 01:21:27,716
I'm sorry, God! I'm sorry, God!

1580
01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:32,762
Oh, God. My heart!

1581
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:36,641
I'm havin' a heart attack!
I can't breathe! Get me down!

1582
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:39,561
Get me down, please. I'm done. I quit.

1583
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:41,646
I'm done!

1584
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:45,567
- There's Dark Shark, right there.
- Dark Shark's doin' 360s. Look!

1585
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:49,529
It's all right.

1586
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:54,492
Dark Shark!

1587
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:01,583
You made it!

1588
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:05,337
Oh my God!

1589
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:10,008
Yeah, Dark Shark!

1590
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:16,139
Pops! You did it, Pops!
You're here now! You're here now!

1591
01:22:16,222 --> 01:22:18,308
Smile! Smile!

1592
01:22:18,391 --> 01:22:19,726
How was it?

1593
01:22:19,809 --> 01:22:21,770
- I almost died.
- But you didn't die.

1594
01:22:21,853 --> 01:22:23,355
- I did.
- You did not.

1595
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:26,399
You been shot nine times!
That ain't nothin'!

1596
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:29,861
I'd rather get shot nine times again.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1597
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:33,448
- I don't wanna never get shot.
- I almost died. I swear to God.

1598
01:22:33,531 --> 01:22:35,951
I was very proud of Dark Shark
for facing his fears.

1599
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:38,912
'Cause even after that,
he just became a different person,

1600
01:22:38,995 --> 01:22:42,791
and he was even more positive,
and he's had a better look at life.

1601
01:22:42,874 --> 01:22:44,417
Y'know? It really changed him.

1602
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:47,462
Remember the deal, though.
You gotta Crip Walk with me.

1603
01:22:47,545 --> 01:22:49,631
All right. Now, you show me
how to Crip Walk.

1604
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:50,840
Throw the C's up.

1605
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:53,134
Just move your legs.
Just give me a little of this.

1606
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:54,594
Now do this.

1607
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:56,513
Yeah, Johnny. Yeah.

1608
01:22:56,596 --> 01:22:58,848
- Little of that.
- Wipe your toe. Wipe it off too.

1609
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:01,142
Yeah. There you go. Wipe.
There you go. There you go.

1610
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:04,604
Damn! Did I do it? Did I do it?

1611
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:07,315
- You did it! You did it!
- Yeah!

1612
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:10,443
- Yeah, Dark Shark!
- Fuck!

1613
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:36,094
Hopefully, my dick turns white
and not black like everybody else's.

1614
01:23:40,765 --> 01:23:42,642
Skills.

1615
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:48,940
- I think I seen this in a <i>Jackass </i>movie.
- You say you saw this in <i>Jackass</i>?

1616
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:51,568
I don't think those guys
are around anymore.

1617
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:55,488

Not a jail suit.

It's a flight suit.

- All right. You got it, daughter.

1645
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:34,963
Yeah.

1646
01:25:36,589 --> 01:25:38,424
Holy shit.

1647
01:25:40,343 --> 01:25:43,388
Hey, Poopies, what happened
with your thong, man?

1648
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:46,099
Well, I took a poop
before I put the thing on,

1649
01:25:46,182 --> 01:25:50,687
and I only wiped twice and shoulda…
shoulda added that third wipe.

1650
01:25:51,187 --> 01:25:53,648
I'm sorry, anyone in this room,

1651
01:25:54,274 --> 01:25:56,776
have you ever been in the clear
after two wipes?

1652
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:02,198
I have never been
in the clear after less than 15.

1653
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:04,992
Safety first.

1654
01:26:06,786 --> 01:26:08,788
Hey, what the shit?

1655
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:10,290
Oh my God!

1656
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:16,504
I'm Eric Manaka,
and this is Face Your Fears.

1657
01:26:17,463 --> 01:26:19,883
Ah.

1658
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:25,388
Was this Felix?

1659
01:26:25,471 --> 01:26:26,598
- Lance.
- Sorry.

1660
01:26:27,932 --> 01:26:30,602
No, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no! No!

1661
01:26:33,396 --> 01:26:35,982
Lance?

1662
01:26:36,065 --> 01:26:38,526
Come on, we gotta focus, guys. Focus!

1663
01:26:53,499 --> 01:26:54,751
Whoo!

1664
01:26:57,503 --> 01:27:00,798
- Blocked, blocked, blocked.
- Fuckin' Mini Miyagi over here.

1665
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:02,550
Mini Miyagi, dude.

1666
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:07,889
- Did I get you?
- Yes.

1667
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:10,642
Your order for today.

1668
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:16,356
- How's this thing work?
- Pull the pin, aim, and shoot.

1669
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:22,487
Wait a minute! Fuck!

1670
01:27:24,113 --> 01:27:27,659
- I'm Catwoman.
- Ooh. I like it.

1671
01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:29,535
I have to go use the ladies'.

1672
01:27:29,619 --> 01:27:31,287
- All right.
- Sorry.

1673
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:33,539
I gotta think about baseball now.

1674
01:27:33,623 --> 01:27:36,417
- Are you guys twerking?
- Woof. Thank you.

1675
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:37,752
Whoo!

1676
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:41,714
Nick Merlino's
going down the hill in a pasta strainer.

1677
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:43,424
He's mentally bankrupt.

1678
01:27:49,472 --> 01:27:51,933
Could you guys talk
about who's stronger?

1679
01:27:52,016 --> 01:27:53,101
I'm stronger.

1680
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:55,812
- Spike sucks to fight.
- Yeah.

1681
01:27:55,895 --> 01:28:00,233
Like, Spike is so surprisingly
hard to deal with in a fight

1682
01:28:00,316 --> 01:28:02,068
'cause he's wiry, but…

1683
01:28:02,151 --> 01:28:04,612
No, no, no, no! Don't! Don't!

1684
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:06,614
See? I'm stronger!

1685
01:28:10,493 --> 01:28:11,786
Motherfucker.

1686
01:28:18,084 --> 01:28:19,294
All right, I'm done.

1687
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:29,220
<i>Reminder, the stunts
